I am fed up with subscriptions plans, every service doing anything they can to optimize retention, ads everywhere, product (especially games) of questionable quality sold at full price.<br>
It's well known but one day Gabe Newell once said
> "We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem"

Despite Steam not being the perfect company despite what some people say, I agree with him on this point.

## Streaming Services
Let's say you want to watch an Disney movie, you go on their website to subscribe to their service, you notice that the lowest tier **includes ads DURING** the movie/show you're watching. You may be tempted with the other, more expensive tiers. Do you know what [Disney says about it?](https://help.disneyplus.com/en-GB/article/disneyplus-ads)

> Disney+ provides some plans for watching movies and series without commercial interruption â€“ Disney+ Standard and Disney+ Premium. However, those tiers may include limited promotional content, ads/promos before or after playback of content, clips and trailers for Disney content, products and services, in addition to branded or sponsored content. Live content or special events, including reruns, may include commercial breaks or commercial messages.

<sub><sup>You know, the usual **"However"**, followed by **"may include *\*every kind of advertisement known to man\*"***</sub></sup><br>

So basically, you pay for a service, and you get the same experience as an regular illegal streaming website filled with crap you find after searching 3min on google, and don't even get me started on quality. How Netflix's going away selling 720p plans to people?
Even in higher plans quality-wise it could be much better, you probably already noticed the poor quality of Netflix in 4K, especially in low-light scenes.<br>

## Video Games

Video games also suffer from this, they are bloated with DRMs to protect the first weeks of sales, but are not removed afterall. They also hurt performances but this is few fps differences. Many DRMs were and are still spywares, some [damaged computers](https://inv3.nadeko.net/watch?v=p-wyIalhdPU), others ['bricked' a lot of games](https://inv3.nadeko.net/watch?v=u8ltfyqD3lM) when they shut down their servers, and some are notoriously bad (like Capcom's one)![EMPRESS talking about the awful capcom's DRM.](/screenshots/empress-capcom-drm_RE7.webp)EMPRESS's take on Capcom's DRM. From her *Resident Evil Village* NFO<br><br>
Why did I say **spyware?** because some of these DRMs run on **Ring 0**, a.k.a **kernel level**.<br>
What is Ring 0/Kernel level? they are hierarchial protection domains for your computer. It means that depending on your level you cannot have access on everything on the computer. Kernel 0 is the highest priviledge domain on your computer. It means that this DRM (or anti cheat) which you don't know its code or functionnalities is running full priviledge on your computer 24/7.


People need to understand that we vote with our wallet. If people keep buying shitty products, unfinished games at launch (or worse, pre-order them), or subscribing to every useless crap they come across, maybe these companies will slow down a little bit on these startegies. I know it will not be the case, and companies will continue to squeeze all the money they can.
